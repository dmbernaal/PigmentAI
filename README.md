# PigmentAI
This repository contains a single experimental Convolutional Neural Network applied to a Skin Cancer dataset. With optimization & fine-tuning of the pre-trained network I was able to achieve close to state-of-the-art peformance. 

With much larger network complexity, more data, better Activation & Gradient Optimizations algorithms the error would reduce significantly. 

## Platform
Pigment was designed to be a Mobile App. Thus in production it would be better to use a low-parameter NN such as Google's EfficientNet.
